# Cosmological Analysis from Angular BAO data

Likelihood for cosmological analysis of angular BAO


The files .py (Angular_BAO.py, ...) sample a markov chain assuming the flat $\Lambda$ CDM as the theoretical model, exploring the parametric space {rd*h,Om} or {rd,H0,Om}.


The Data:

     ---> Final_Table.txt: File contains the BAO measurements as described by the paper ...
          .1th Column : Redshift
          .2th Column : Angula BAO Scale measuremnts biased 
          .3th Column : Angula BAO Scale measuremnts unbiased
          .4th Column : Statistical Measuremnt's erro
          .5th Column : Systematic Measuremnt's erro
          .6th Column : Total error = sqrt(stat**2 + sys**2)         
          .7th Column : Perncentile of total error relative to the unbiased measurements 

The data (the angular BAO measured) and its covariance matrix are avaiable in the directory 


There are three types of analysis.
